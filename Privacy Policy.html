<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

by Cyber-Aid Repairs. This Privacy Policy applies to our Website, cyberaidrepairs, and its associated subdomains (collectively, our "Service"). <br>
By accessing or using our Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to our collection, storage, use, and disclosure of your personal<br> 
information as described in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.
</p>
<h2>INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED</h2>
<p>
There is some information like your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics – is collected automatically when you visit our <br>
platform. This information may be used to connect your computer to the Internet. Other information collected automatically could be a login, e-mail address, <br>
password, computer and connection information such as browser plug-in types and versions and time zone setting, operating systems and platforms, purchase <br>
history, (we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other Users), the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through and from our <br>
Website that may include date and time; cookie number; parts of the site you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call our Customer <br>
Services. We may also use browser data such as cookies (also known as Flash Locui Shared Objects) or similar data on certain parts of our Website for fraud <br>
prevention and other purposes. During your visits, we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information including page <br>
response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods <br>
used to browse away from the page. We may also collect technical information to help us identify your device for fraud prevention and diagnostic purposes.
</p>

<h2>
HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h2>
<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)</li>
<li>To improve our service (we continually strive to improve our service offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</li>
<li>To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)</li>
<li>To process transactions</li>
<li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature</li>
<li>To send periodic emails</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>WHEN DO WE USE CUSTOMER INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTIES?</h2>
<p>
We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us. For example, when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming our<br>
customer, we receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to us. We also occasionally collect information that is <br>
made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites <br>
and changing your privacy settings.
</p>


<h2>DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h2>
<p>
We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non- personal, with third parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and <br>
marketing partners, and others who provide our content or whose products or services we think may interest you. We may also share it with our current and <br>
future affiliated companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, we may also share or <br>
transfer your personal and non- personal information to our successors-in-interest. We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions <br>
and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and our service, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage <br>
marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through our platform. We will likely <br>
share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and <br>
for you. We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, <br>
application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection <br>
speed, whether you have visited the service in a shared location, and type of device used to visit the service. They may aggregate information about our <br>
advertising and what you see on the service and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers. We may also disclose personal and <br>
non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or <br>
appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of <br>
the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, <br>
laws, rules and regulations.
</p>

<h2>WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND END USERS?</h2>
<p>
We will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.
</p>

<h2>
COULD MY INFORMATION BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER COUNTRIES?
</h2>
<p>
We are incorporated in South Africa. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be <br>
transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the <br>
world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by <br>
applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
</p>


<h2>IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SERVICE SECURE?</h2>
<p>
We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent <br>
unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including <br>
encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to <br>
protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal <br>
information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.
</p>


<h2>CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>
The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct their <br>
information as detailed in our internal company employment policies. Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of <br>
personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your <br>
preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about <br>
you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on <br>
other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, <br>
correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your <br>
identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account <br>
information at all times. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to <br>
us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a <br>
non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases <br>
we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably <br>
and technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the <br>
organization of which you are a customer.

purposes in order to administer benefits to workers and screen applicants. You may contact us in order to (1) update or correct your information, (2) change <br>
your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) receive a record of the information we have relating to you. <br>
Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third <br>
parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.

Privacy Policy.

<h2>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>
We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for <br>
anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there no need for us <br>
to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.

required to keep the information confidential. After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is <br>
never kept on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on <br>
