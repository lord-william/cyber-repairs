</p>
<h2>INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COLLECTED</h2>
<p>

history, (we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other Users), the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through and from our <br>
Website that may include date and time; cookie number; parts of the site you viewed or searched for; and the phone number you used to call our Customer <br>

</p>

<h2>
HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT?</h2>
<p>Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li>To personalize your experience (your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs)</li>
<li>To improve our service (we continually strive to improve our service offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you)</li>
<li>To improve customer service (your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs)</li>
<li>To process transactions</li>
<li>To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature</li>
<li>To send periodic emails</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>WHEN DO WE USE CUSTOMER INFORMATION FROM THIRD PARTIES?</h2>
<p>
We receive some information from the third parties when you contact us. For example, when you submit your email address to us to show interest in becoming our<br>
customer, we receive information from a third party that provides automated fraud detection services to us. We also occasionally collect information that is <br>
made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social media websites make public by visiting these websites <br>
and changing your privacy settings.
</p>


<h2>DO WE SHARE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT WITH THIRD PARTIES?</h2>
<p>
We may share the information that we collect, both personal and non- personal, with third parties such as advertisers, contest sponsors, promotional and <br>
marketing partners, and others who provide our content or whose products or services we think may interest you. We may also share it with our current and <br>
future affiliated companies and business partners, and if we are involved in a merger, asset sale or other business reorganization, we may also share or <br>
transfer your personal and non- personal information to our successors-in-interest. We may engage trusted third party service providers to perform functions <br>
and provide services to us, such as hosting and maintaining our servers and our service, database storage and management, e-mail management, storage <br>
marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products and services you may purchase through our platform. We will likely <br>
share your personal information, and possibly some non-personal information, with these third parties to enable them to perform these services for us and <br>
for you. We may share portions of our log file data, including IP addresses, for analytics purposes with third parties such as web analytics partners, <br>
application developers, and ad networks. If your IP address is shared, it may be used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection <br>
speed, whether you have visited the service in a shared location, and type of device used to visit the service. They may aggregate information about our <br>
advertising and what you see on the service and then provide auditing, research and reporting for us and our advertisers. We may also disclose personal and <br>
non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or <br>
appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of <br>
the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, <br>
laws, rules and regulations.
</p>

<h2>WHERE AND WHEN IS INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND END USERS?</h2>
<p>
We will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal information about you from third parties as described above.
</p>

<h2>
COULD MY INFORMATION BE TRANSFERRED TO OTHER COUNTRIES?
</h2>
<p>
We are incorporated in South Africa. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you, or from use of our help services may be <br>
transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the <br>
world, including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such data. To the fullest extent allowed by <br>
applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to the trans-border transfer and hosting of such information.
</p>


<h2>IS THE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH OUR SERVICE SECURE?</h2>
<p>
We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent <br>
unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including <br>
encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to <br>
protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal <br>
information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.
</p>


<h2>CAN I UPDATE OR CORRECT MY INFORMATION?</h2>
<p>
The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct their <br>
information as detailed in our internal company employment policies. Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of <br>
personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable information, (2) change your <br>
preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about <br>
you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on <br>
other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, <br>
correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your <br>
identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account <br>
information at all times. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to <br>
us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a <br>
non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases <br>
we actively use, and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably <br>
and technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we have about you, you may do so by contacting the <br>
organization of which you are a customer.

your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or (3) receive a record of the information we have relating to you. <br>

parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.

Privacy Policy.

<h2>HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfill the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for <br>
anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there no need for us <br>
to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.
